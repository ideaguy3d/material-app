## I'm just building this app to have a User Interface for my Algorithms, TypeScript & ES2015 studies.

I've decided to try to get really good at es6 & ts so I can practice implementing 
the algorithms from [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) 
This'll be the project I implement them in. 

### Goals for this project

* Install the latest [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org).

* `Use ES2015/TypeScript instead of Java/C++ to implement the algorithms`

* `Have a really pretty User Interface to see the output in`

* `Implement some interactivity`

* `Learn and Have fun` The most important Goal ^_^
